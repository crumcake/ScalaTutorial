# What Operating Systems Can Support Scala?

Conveniently, as a JVM language, Scala is not tied to any particular OS. It is capable of running on Windows, iOS, or Linux systems with ease.

# Installation Instructions

As I run a Windows OS, I only have direct experience in installing Scala on a Windows computer. Therefore, those are the instructions I will share here.
Before you do any downloading, you need to ensure your machine has JDK already installed. You need to go to your Control Panel, then go from there to Programs and Features.
Check to see if the Java Development Kit is listed. If it is, you can move on to the next step.

Go to https://www.scala-lang.org/download/
The page has a lot of different options for how to download and install Scala. As I am a beginner in the language, I opted to download it through a full-featured IDE
that I was already familiar with, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. I simply installed the Scala Plugin through the IntelliJ settings, and there it was.

# Where do you write Scala Programs?
I've been writing my Scala Programs on IntelliJ IDEA. I feel more comfortable coding with an IDE than through the command line.

# Where do you run your Scala Programs?
I also run my codes through IntelliJ IDEA.

# Is there a lot of boiler-plate code that you need to write a program?  Or can you just start writing?
Scala does require some 'boiler-plate code'. It is meant to be interoperable with Java, after all.

# How do you write comments in Scala?
/*The same way as Java*/
//This also works.
