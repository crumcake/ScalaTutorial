# Declaring a Function in Scala
Functions in Scala are declared with the following pattern:

   def function_name ([parameter_list]) : [return_type] = {
  // function body
}

First, you use 'def' to declare it a function. Then, you give it a name in lower camel case. You define a parameter list preceded by data-type within closed parentheses, you label the return type, and then you can create the actual body of the function within a closed pair of curly brackets.
