# Scala

Scala is a general-purpose programming language that provides support for both object-oriented and functional programming. It was designed to offer interoperability with Java, and thus is meant to be compiled into Java bytecode and to be run on a Java Virtual Machine. Scala offers several features not present in Java, including immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching.

# History

Scala was released in 2003 by German computer scientist and professor Martin Odersky of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. The name Scala is a combonation of the words scalable and language. Scala, as a 'scalable language', is supposed to grow with the demands of its users. It was designed with the aim to address the many criticisms of Java.

# Usage

Scala is popular among companies that handle big data. Two users of note are LinkedIn and Twitter, which utilize Scala in their back-end code. As a general-purpose language, it has a wide variety of possible uses. It is, however, noted in comparison to other JVM alternatives for being statically typed.

The currently most popular GitHub.com projects related to Scala are:

  2. This Scala 2 compiler and standard library https://github.com/scala/scala
  3. A machine learning server https://github.com/apache/predictionio
 
# Resources

My primary resources for my work this semester will be: the tutorials avaliable on the Scala source website: https://www.scala-lang.org/, the book 'Progamming in Scala' 2nd edition, ISBN 0981531644, and other resources in the Scala community. When I get stuck, I will probably look with caution on websites such as StackOverflow.com.
